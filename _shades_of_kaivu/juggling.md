My journey into the world of juggling began during my college years at IIT Delhi. What started as a curious experiment with three tennis balls quickly evolved into a passionate pursuit of flow arts. Through countless hours of practice in the hostel corridors and campus lawns, I gradually mastered various patterns and transitions, finding an incredible meditative quality in the rhythmic motion of objects in flight.

The juggling community has been an incredible source of inspiration and growth. From participating in juggling meetups to performing at college festivals, each experience has added new dimensions to my practice. I've expanded my repertoire to include clubs, rings, and even contact juggling, discovering how each prop brings its own unique challenges and rewards. This art form has taught me valuable lessons about patience, persistence, and the joy of continuous learning.
