Dance has been my gateway to understanding the profound connection between music, movement, and emotion. My exploration of various dance forms began with classical Indian dance and gradually expanded to include contemporary styles. Each practice session has been a journey of self-discovery, where the boundaries between physical expression and emotional storytelling blur into a seamless flow of energy.

The dance community at IIT Delhi has been instrumental in shaping my growth as a dancer. Through collaborative performances and workshops, I've learned how different dance styles can complement each other, creating unique fusion performances. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but have also deepened my appreciation for the cultural richness that dance embodies.
