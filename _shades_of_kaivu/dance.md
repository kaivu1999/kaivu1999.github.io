    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">The Journey Begins</h2>
    <p>Dance has been my gateway to understanding the profound connection between music, movement, and emotion. My exploration of various dance forms began with classical Indian dance and gradually expanded to include contemporary styles. Each practice session has been a journey of self-discovery, where the boundaries between physical expression and emotional storytelling blur into a seamless flow of energy.</p>

## Community & Learning
The dance community at IIT Delhi has been instrumental in shaping my growth as a dancer. Through collaborative performances and workshops, I've learned how different dance styles can complement each other, creating unique fusion performances. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but have also deepened my appreciation for the cultural richness that dance embodies.

## Style Evolution
What began as traditional training has evolved into a personal style that blends various influences. The precision of classical forms meets the freedom of contemporary expression, creating a unique dance vocabulary that continues to evolve with each performance.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2a7ae2;">Dance Philosophy</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Dance is more than just movementâ€”it's a conversation between body and soul, between rhythm and emotion. Through dance, I've learned that every gesture carries meaning, every pause tells a story, and every performance is an opportunity to connect with both the audience and one's inner self.</p>
